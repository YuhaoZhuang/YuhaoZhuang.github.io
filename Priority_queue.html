            <h2> Priority_Queues</h2>
            <p> A priority queue has two operations:</p>
            <p> Push: add item with associate priority among the list; Pop: remove item with the highest priority among the list. </p>
            <p> Priorty queue can be implemented by a Binary Heap</p>
            <h2> Binary Heap</h2>
            <p> A Binary Heap is like a binary search tree, with two types of operation: </p>
            <p> Min-heap: each node's key is less than or eqal to each of its children. Max-heap: each node's key is greater than or equal to each of its children. </p>
            <p>> The lead node doesn't have to be ordered</p>
            <p> Root node also always have the highest priority</p>
            <img src="MinHeapAndMaxHeap.png", width= "490", height = "300">
            <p> Pushing values into priority queues: same as the push in binary searach tree, except at the lowest level, doesn't have to care which priority first. Then, while the node has a parent and the parent priority higher than current node, switch these nodes to keep the min or max order remained </p>
            <p> Poping values out from priority queues:  Same concept as the remove in binary search tree, except keep finding the node's left child, and move that final node to the root. Then keep moving the node to the heap's right subtree to make sure heap order is respected again.</p>
